			<p>“Take a deep breath” might be some of the best advice around. It’s one of the easiest and most effective ways to relieve stress, and has been for thousands of years. When we take a slow inhale through the nose and a big, long exhale through the mouth, we’re signaling to the brain and body that we’re safe, that it’s okay to calm down. Within a matter of seconds, we start to feel more relaxed.</p>
			<p>Most of us rarely need to think about breathing. But learning to pay attention to our breath can improve how we feel and how we behave. Often, taking a moment before we react to stressful situations can make all the difference. With practice, we can purposefully slow down our breath anytime and anywhere until we feel less frazzled and more confident.</p>
			<p>Here, we’ll share how to try breathing exercises to reduce stress so the next time we have to give a big speech, hear some disappointing news, or get a case of the Sunday scaries, we’ll know what to do to feel better: breathe.</p>
			<p>DISCLAIMER: Please consult your doctor or medical provider to ensure which breathwork is suitable for you. Breathing exercises may present a risk of harm for people with certain medical and/or neurological conditions including epilepsy, cardiovascular issues, anxiety and PTSD, or people who are pregnant.</p>
